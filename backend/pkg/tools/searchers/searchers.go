// Package searchers holds the individual web-search primitives (google, duckduckgo,
// brave, tavily, perplexity, traversaal, sploitus, searxng, firecrawl, and the optional
// internal browser-analytics engine) that the tools.web_search orchestrator drives.
//
// Each searcher wraps a single provider, keeps its own Langfuse observation, and
// returns the ORIGINAL error — classified as *RetryableError or *FatalError — so the
// orchestrator can decide whether to retry the same engine or fall back to the next
// one. Searchers never mask an error as a "failed to search…" string and never write
// to the database search-log; both concerns belong to the orchestrator.
//
// This package must not import pentagi/pkg/tools (the orchestrator imports this
// package). It depends only on neutral packages: config, database (for the
// SearchengineType attribution enum), system (HTTP client), and observability.
