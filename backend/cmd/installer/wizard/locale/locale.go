• Size Management disabled → sections can grow 2x larger than limits
• Response Limit prevents single large outputs from dominating context
• User message compression (SummHumanInQA) saves 5% but loses original phrasing

Reduce for smaller models:
• Recent Sections: 1-2 (vs 3+ default)
• Section Limit: 25-35KB (vs 50KB+)
• Disable Size Management for simple conversations

Common mistakes:
• Setting Recent Sections too high (main cause of context overflow)
• Enabling Size Management with very low Section Limits (over-compression)
• Mismatched QA limits (high bytes + low sections = ineffective)

Current algorithm compresses older content while preserving recent context quality.`

Default tuning (3 Recent Sections, 75KB limits):
• Typical range: 8K-40K tokens
• Good for: Extended dialogues, reasoning chains, context-dependent tasks
• Models: Works well with 32K+ context models

Adjustments by model type:
• Short context (≤16K): Recent Sections=1-2, Section Limit=45KB
• Long context (128K+): Can increase Recent Sections=5-7
• High-frequency chat: Reduce Recent Sections=2 for faster responses

Advanced tuning:
• QA Memory 200KB+ for document analysis conversations
• Response Limit 24-32KB for detailed technical responses
• Keep User Messages uncompressed (SummHumanInQA=false) for better context

Performance optimization:
• Each Recent Section ≈ 9-18KB in assistant mode
• Size Management reduces growth by ~20% but may lose detail
• QA compression triggers less often due to larger default limits

Size Management enabled by default - maintains conversation flow while preventing context overflow.

Execution Monitoring (⚠️  BETA):
Automatically invokes adviser (mentor) to analyze execution patterns, detect loops, suggest alternative strategies, and prevent agents from fixating on single approach. Thresholds: consecutive identical calls (default: 5) and total calls (default: 10).

Task Planning (⚠️  BETA):
Generates 3-7 step execution plans before specialist agents begin work. Prevents scope creep and improves success rates. Works best when adviser uses enhanced configuration (stronger model or maximum reasoning mode).

Tool Call Limits (always active):
Hard limits prevent infinite loops: General agents default 100, Limited agents default 20. Works independently from beta features.

OPEN SOURCE MODELS < 32B (Qwen3.5-27B, DeepSeek-V3, Llama-3.1-70B):
✓ ENABLE both beta features - ESSENTIAL for quality results
✓ Testing shows 2x improvement in result quality vs. baseline
✓ Configure adviser with enhanced settings for best performance
✓ Ideal for air-gapped deployments with local LLM inference

Performance: 2-3x increase in tokens/time, 2x improvement in quality for models < 32B.

⚠️  BETA WARNING: Features under active development. Recommended for open source models < 32B despite beta status. For cloud APIs with larger models, keep disabled.

Basic setup requires enabling capabilities: Docker Access allows spawning additional containers for specialized tools, while Network Admin grants low-level network permissions essential for scanning tools like nmap.

Storage operates via Docker volumes by default, or host directories when Work Directory is specified. Connection settings control the Docker daemon location - local socket for standard setups, or remote TCP with TLS for distributed environments.

Default images serve as fallbacks: general tasks use standard images, while security testing defaults to pentesting-focused containers. Public IP enables reverse shell attacks by providing workers with a reachable address for target callbacks. Usually it's a local interface address of the host machine with Docker daemon running for the workers containers.

Configuration combines based on scenario: enable both capabilities for full pentesting, use Work Directory for persistent artifacts, or configure remote connection for isolated Docker environments.`
